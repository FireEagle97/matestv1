# App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a visitor first arrives at the platform landing page, they see a clear invitation to either sign in or register for a new account. Two distinct registration options are presented: one for regular users and one for producers. Each registration form requests an email address, a chosen password, answers to security questions, and a checkbox to confirm agreement with the appropriate Terms and Conditions page. The link to the Users Terms Page or Producers Terms Page opens in a new window so that users can review legal text before agreeing. After submitting the form, the system sends an automated verification email containing a unique link. Clicking that link confirms the email address, at which point users are guided to set or confirm their password if needed and then redirected to a welcome screen. From the welcome screen, users can proceed to personalize their profile. If a returning user clicks “Sign In,” they enter their email and password on the sign-in page, with the option to request a password reset link by clicking “Forgot Password.” That link is emailed to them and directs them to a secure password reset form. Upon entering a new password and confirming it, they are redirected back to the login page. When signed in, the user’s profile name appears in the header, along with a dropdown offering “Account Settings” and “Sign Out.” Choosing “Sign Out” safely ends the session and returns the visitor to the public landing page.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After logging in, the default view depends on the user’s role. Regular users see the Movie Catalogue homepage featuring a large banner with featured movies, a search bar at the top, and a horizontal row of genre filters beneath. Scrolling down reveals paginated grids of movie thumbnails labeled with titles and prices. A fixed header contains navigation links to Home, My Library, and Account Settings, plus a cart icon that displays pending purchases. On the left, a collapsible sidebar shows the user’s profile picture and quick links to Library, Purchase History, and Notifications. Producers are greeted with their Producer Dashboard by default, which displays a summary panel of total sales, earnings, and views for the current month, along with buttons labeled Upload Movie and View Earnings History. Below the summary, a table lists all submitted movies with columns for title, status (Pending, Approved, Rejected), and action buttons for Edit, Request Takedown, or View Analytics. The header for producers mirrors the user header but replaces My Library with Producer Settings and adds a Notifications icon. Administrators sign in to the Admin Panel home, which features a sidebar for Producer Management, Movie Management, Payment Management, Featured Movies, and System Settings. The central area shows live counts of pending registrations, pending uploads, and pending payout requests, each linked to the appropriate review queue.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

### Producer Profile Management and Payment Settings

From the Producer Dashboard, clicking Producer Settings takes the user to a Profile Management page. Here, producers can update their name, bio, contact email, phone number, and upload profile pictures or banner images. After saving, a confirmation message appears briefly. A tab marked Payment Settings leads to a form where producers choose between bank transfer, PayPal, or Stripe. They enter routing numbers or connect their Stripe account via OAuth. When they submit, the system runs a small test transaction or instant verification check. Once confirmed, a green badge indicates that payment details are verified.

### Movie Upload and Metadata Entry

When the producer clicks Upload Movie, they arrive at the Movie Upload page. At the top, instructions explain file size and type limits for video, audio, subtitle, and Proof of Ownership document uploads. Producers drag and drop or browse to select files. Upon selection, the system displays each file with an upload progress bar. As soon as video uploads finish, the backend automatically invokes FFmpeg to transcode files into adaptive HLS streams, storing results in DigitalOcean spaces and delivering through a CDN. Below the file section, fields appear for entering title, description, genres, and sale price. A separate area prompts for Proof of Ownership documents, enforcing automatic checks on file type and maximum size. Clicking Submit sends the movie submission to the admin review queue. The producer is then redirected back to the Dashboard, and a new row appears with status “Pending.”

### Producer Sales, Analytics, and Payment Requests

On the Producer Dashboard, selecting View Analytics on a specific movie opens a full-page chart view. Time-series graphs of view counts and sales appear alongside revenue breakdowns per region. An Export CSV button triggers a file download of raw data. When total earnings exceed the $50 threshold, the Request Payment button at the top becomes active. Clicking it brings up a confirmation modal summarizing the payout amount, commission at 50 percent automatically deducted for Matestv, and the net amount. Confirming creates a payout request visible in the Payment Requests list and notifies the admin. Producers can revisit the Payment History page to see past payouts and download PDF receipts.

### User Browsing, Purchase, and Library Access

Users navigate the Movie Catalogue by typing keywords into the search bar or clicking genre filters. Selecting a movie thumbnail opens a detail page that displays a high-resolution banner, title, synopsis, price, and a Play Preview button. To purchase, the user clicks Buy Now, which brings them to a checkout page summarizing the movie, showing payment options (Stripe or PayPal), and a final total. After entering payment credentials and confirming, the page transitions to a Thank You screen that includes a Download Receipt link and a button to Go to My Library. Simultaneously, an email receipt is sent. In the Library, movies are listed with a Watch Now button. Streaming is delivered via HLS from the CDN. Even if a producer later requests a takedown, users who have purchased retain uninterrupted access in their Library.

### Administrator Approval, Movie Management, and Featured Movies

From the Admin Panel sidebar, clicking Producer Management lists pending producer registrations. Each entry shows the producer’s profile information, uploaded Proof of Ownership samples, and action buttons to Approve or Reject. Approving triggers an email notification; rejecting prompts the admin to enter a reason, which is included in the rejection email. Movie Management shows uploaded movies pending review. Admins inspect metadata and video previews streamed from Spaces, then click Approve or Reject, optionally entering a rejection reason. Payment Management displays payout requests sorted by date. Admins select a request, review the net amount, and process payment manually through Stripe or bank transfer. Upon marking the request as Paid, the system resets the movie’s sales counters and emails the producer with confirmation. Under Featured Movies, admins set the flat fee in a simple form, choose movies from a searchable list, and assign a feature duration. Once saved, those movies appear in the front-end featured banner. Adjusting fees or removing movies is done on the same page, and producers are debited immediately upon feature activation.

## Settings and Account Management

All users access their account settings by clicking their profile name in the header. This takes them to a unified Account Settings page with tabs for Personal Information, Security, and Notifications. In Personal Information, they can update their name, email, phone, and profile picture. The Security tab allows changing the password, answering security questions, and enabling two-factor authentication if desired. Notification Preferences let users toggle email alerts for events such as movie approvals, purchase receipts, or payment status changes. Producers see an additional Payment Settings tab to modify their bank, PayPal, or Stripe details. After saving in any tab, a brief confirmation banner appears, and a link returns them to the Dashboard or My Library.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

If users enter invalid data on any form—such as an improperly formatted email, mismatched passwords, or oversized file uploads—inline error messages display next to the relevant fields, explaining the issue in plain language. Attempting to access a restricted page without the correct role redirects the user to a 403 Forbidden page with a link back to the home dashboard. During video transcoding or file uploads, network interruptions trigger an on-screen alert offering a Retry button and automatically attempt reconnection. If the password reset link is expired or already used, the user sees an error explaining the link is invalid and prompting them to request a new one. When administrators attempt to process a payout that has already been marked as paid, the system prevents duplication by showing a notice that the request is already complete.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

From their first click on the landing page, visitors choose whether to become a producer or user, register with email verification, and set up secure passwords. Users swiftly customize profiles and dive into a rich movie catalogue, making purchases through Stripe or PayPal, and then streaming favorite titles in their personal Library. Producers fill out detailed profiles, configure payment methods, and upload movies with metadata and proof documents. Their content undergoes transcoding to HLS for smooth delivery, and they track performance via dashboards, requesting payouts once earnings cross the threshold. Administrators oversee registrations, content approvals, financial transactions, and the Featured Movies section, all while automated email notifications keep every stakeholder informed. Together, these flows ensure a seamless experience from sign-up to streaming, earning, and platform management.
